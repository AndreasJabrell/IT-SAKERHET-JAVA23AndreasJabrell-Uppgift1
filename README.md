# Secure User Management System — IT Security Project

This project was developed as part of a course in **IT Security** and focuses on building a secure authentication and user management system.

The application demonstrates how to securely handle user credentials using password hashing and implements a login system with functionality to add and remove users.

---

## Features
- User registration  
- Secure login system  
- Password hashing using SHA-256  
- Add and remove users  
- Server-side validation  

---

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java  
- **Security:** SHA-256 password hashing  
- **Architecture:** Backend authentication system  

---

## Security Focus
This project focuses on:
- Secure password storage using hashing (SHA-256)  
- No plaintext passwords stored in the database  
- Authentication handled on the server side  
- Protection against unauthorized access  

---

## Project Context
This application was developed as part of a course in **IT Security** with the goal of learning how to implement secure login systems and user management.

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Implemented password hashing using SHA-256  
- Built a secure login and authentication flow  
- Designed a basic user management system  
- Gained practical experience in IT security principles  

---

## Security Note
This project uses SHA-256 for password hashing as part of a learning exercise. In production systems, a dedicated password hashing algorithm such as BCrypt or Argon2 is recommended.
